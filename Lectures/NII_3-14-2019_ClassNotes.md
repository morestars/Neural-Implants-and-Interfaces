* shape of recording due to changing impedance pathway over time, path of current may change
* amplitude of recording consistently goes down over time
* SNR remains consistent
* Mechanical failure --> nail in soft material analogy, movement on order of microns
* Signal quality affected by impedance and many other factors
* closer to blood vessels or breaking flood vessels is the main problem that leads to immune response and ecapsulation
* Excess release of ATP is lethal to cells
* Excess ATP prevents Ca release and presynaptic terminals become silences, no longer releasing vesicles into the cleft
