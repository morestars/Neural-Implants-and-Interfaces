# Cochlear Implants

### The Healthy Ear
* cochlea is really a whole in bone, not a typical "organ"
* low pitch --> apex
* high pitch --> base
* basilar membran is loose at the apex
* frequency encoded based on which specific neurons activated
* loudness encoded based on number of neurons excited

### Transduction of Sound
* stable reference proveded by tectorial membrane
* transduction organs are the hair cells
* stereocilia on hair cells give them their name
* 3 rows of hair cells called outer hair cells
  * further away from where nerve comes in
* inner hair cells in single row
* some efferent fibers
* many afferent go to each one of the hair cells
* inner hair cells are main sound sensors

### Outer hair cells amplify signal
### Inner hair cells transduce signal
* HC physically deviate
* IHC --> principle receptor
* OHC --> 

### OHC create cochlea amplifier
* cell elongation creates more basilar membrane movement
* a

### OHC amplify basilar membrane vibrations a lot
* 40dB
* u_bm: basilar membrane motion
* passive: membrane moves by itself
* 40dB increase = 100x increase, ie. gain of 100
* loss of OHC causes many hearing loss

### IHC are mechanical sensors

### Sound Encoding: Spatial and Rate coding
* spatial encoding: which neuron fires along the length of the cochlea
* neurons fire at most 400 times per second
* temporal coding lost at high frequencies
  * some in refractory while other are not
  * need to look at multiple neurons
  * rate coding
  
## Afferent fibers
* 2 types
* each HC has many afferent that it contacts
* low spontaneous rate fiber
* high spontatneous rate fiber
* HSR fiber fires at a nonzero rate when no sound is present
  * increases rate of firing when tone introduced
  * increaseed amplitude of tone does not correspond to increased firing rate
  * low-threshold fiber
    * less sound needed to respond
* LSR
  * gradual curve
  * need higher levels of sound
  * specific amplitude of given pitch better encoded
    * HSR will be saturated at this point

* Take a look at the blue-red curve for LSR and HSR in noise

### Cochlear Implant is an auditory prosthesis

### Business end of the implant
* electrode into cochlea

### Signal Processing
* separate based on frequencies
* bandpass filter for electrode positions
* amplitude given by rectifier and LPF
  * envelope detector
* spatial coding

### Number of electrodes

### Vocoder
* model of what a cochlear implant listener hears
* stimulates a range of freqencies for each electrode

### Channel interaction and current spread
* major problem
* channel interaction: unintended...
* large spread of stimulation

### Electrode interaction degrades performance
* difference between 8 and 64 electrode channels is no different in practice

### Large variability in speech scores
* how well they can detect/understand speech
* results indpenedent of manufacturer and strategy

### Spread of neural activation
* electrode proximity/placement to hair cells
  * closer to medial wall, closer to neurons
* neural survival
* stim pattern

### Solutions to electrode interaction imporve electrodes
* more directed electrodes, but also have physical spacer behind the electrodes that help preven spread
* pre-curved prevents damage to basilar membrane
* positioner gets it closer to medial wall

### Stimulation strategies
* simultaneous analog stimulation (SAS)
  * only one that doesnt use biphasic stimulation
  * still fast enough that electrochemistry is avoided
  * bipolar stimulation of closely spaced electrodes
  * worked, but fell out of practie
* CIS: continuous interleaved stimulation
  * separation of stim by time
  * 250us, full biphasic pulse is 500us, 10 electrodes, 5ms
* Speak/ACE/NofM
  * biggest signal only stimulated
* Current steering/tripolar stimulation
  * reduces spreading
  * need higher amplitude to get signal to neuron
  
### How fast?
* CIS
  * most common stim strategy
* 200 pps

### What cells are stimulated
* IHC?, OHC?, fibers?
* High SR getting stimulated because they have bigger diameter
* small OHC can't get depolarized
* Resistance
* No difference across the small membrane, need much higher current
